# Hello Hackers

##Intro to Arguments
The challenge is to get the flag,by using the commands with a single argument of hackers

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{g_XNDzFsMvBRO3MizjqyzNw2n40.QX4YjM1wiM2EzNzEzW}`

The challenge is to run the hacker argument using hello command
```bash
hello hackers
```

### New Learnings
I got the clear understanding about the commands and how to use arguments.And I also got to know about the command echo which returns all of its arguments.
