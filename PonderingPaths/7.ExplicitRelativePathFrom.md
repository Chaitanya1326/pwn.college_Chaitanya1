## Explicit Relative Path,from /
The challenge is to get the flag,by using relative path of run file using explicitly using '.' 
### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{0KuIVKnEDbBlyIjhdbtAZmIlUrd.QXwUTN0wiM2EzNzEzW}`
`

As Relative path mean that the path should not start with the root and by explicitly does mean using ./challenge/run
```bash
cd /
./challenge/run
```
