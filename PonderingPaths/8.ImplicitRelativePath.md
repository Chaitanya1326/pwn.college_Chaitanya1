The challenge is to get the flag,by using implicit relative path of run file.
### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{Q7ZntBRzhYilyQT9_TLpCgY_tGQ.QXxUTN0wiM2EzNzEzW}`
`

The directory of the challenge file should be /challenge and we have to implicitly call teh run file which is ./run
```bash
cd /challenge
./run
```
