# Pondering Paths

## Implicit Relative Path from /
The challenge is to get the flag,by using relative path of run file and which is in the challenge directory. 
### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{k7HY1x1H3kmf0Jj6qdLv-rz4UZM.QX5QTN0wiM2EzNzEzW}`
`

As Relative path mean that the path should not start with the root and we should use cd / and challenge/run which is the relative path.
```bash
cd /
challenge/run
```
